<p>	Hi, My name is Charles but I go by Charlie most often. I am currently a student at Waketech Community College for Computer Programming and Development. I have spent two years as an automotive technician as well as two years in sales. I have many hobbies including computer building as well as gaming. A few fun facts about me would be that I have always had an interest in cars and technology, I have learned most of my previous knowledge of both by either self teaching or family.</p>
